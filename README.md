## Next Generation Smart Contracting Platform
**Convolutional Smart Contracts**
- Support higher throughput than otherwise possible.
- Support higher execution quality than otherwise possible.
- Lowest possible resource usage by transactions overall.
- New execution paradigms are supported, such as netting.

By executing all of the transactions going into a given contract within a single block together as a unit rather than one-by-one, smart contracts are able to save resource usage and improve execution quality by connecting dots not otherwise possible.
